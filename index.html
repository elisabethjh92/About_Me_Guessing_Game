        I lived in four countries, India, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand and United States. <br />
        <br />
 
       
        I was born in India but lived there for a short time. I spent my childhood in Saudi Arabia and my college years in New Zealand. I moved to California first and made Seattle my home in last 7 years.<br />
        <br />

        
        I love working with kids and being around kids. I live with my husband. We have two kids and a 10year old dog.
        We adopted our dog first in California and then had two kids in Seattle.<br />
        <br />


        I did my medical training in New Zealand and my Pediatric residency in California. I did further studying in University of Washington, Seattle, before starting my first job here in Seattle.<br />
        <br />


        I decided to take time off this year to spend time with my family and learn a new skill. I enjoy working with computers and enjoy medicine. But <em>seriously</em> technology use can be improved so much more in healthcare. By learning technical skills including coding, I hope to develop apps that I can use in healthcare and make life easier for my colleagues. <br />
        <br />


        My other passion is volunteering at the local temple and teaching our kids our culture and different languages. I speak 3 languages spoken in India, can read/write Arabic, Hindi, Gujarati along with English. Both my kids learn French and I hope to learn from them eventually. <br />
